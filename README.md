 ## 1.Merge sort
 Merge Sort is a kind of Divide and Conquer algorithm in computer programrming. It is one of the most popular sorting algorithms and a great way to develop confidence in building recursive algorithms. <br/>

 ## 2.Bubble sort
 Bubble sort algorithm starts by comparing the first two elements of an array and swapping if necessary, i.e., if you want to sort the elements of array in ascending order and if the first element is greater than second then, you need to swap the elements but, if the first element is smaller than second, you mustn't swap the element. <br/>
